# ircd.conf - configuration file for ircd version ircu2.10
#
# Last Updated:  20, March 2002.
#
# Written by Niels <niels@undernet.org>, based on the original example.conf,
# server code and some real-life (ahem) experience.
#
# Updated and heavily modified by Braden <dbtem@yahoo.com>.
#
# Rewritten by A1kmm(Andrew Miller)<a1kmm@mware.virtualave.net> to support
# the new flex/bison configuration parser.
#
# Thanks and credits to: Run, Trillian, Cym, Morrissey, Chaos, Flynn,
#                        Xorath, WildThang, Mmmm, SeKs, Ghostwolf and
#                        all other Undernet IRC Admins and Operators,
#                        and programmers working on the Undernet ircd.
#
# This is an example of the configuration file used by the Undernet ircd.
#
# This document is based on a (fictious) server in Europe with a
# connection to the Undernet IRC network. It is primarily a leaf server,
# but if all the other hubs in Europe aren't in service, it can connect
# to one in the US by itself.
#
# The configuration format consists of a number of blocks in the format
#  BlockName { setting = number; setting2 = "string"; setting3 = yes; };
# Note that comments start from a #(hash) and go to the end of the line.
# Whitespace(space, tab, or carriage return/linefeed) are ignored and may
# be used to make the configuration file more readable.
#
# Please note that when ircd puts the configuration lines into practice,
# it parses them exactly the other way round than they are listed here.
# It uses the blocks in reverse order.
#
# This means that you should start your Client blocks with the
# "fall through", most vanilla one, and end with the most detailed.
#
# There is a difference between the "hostname" and the "server name"
# of the machine that the server is run on. For example, the host can
# have "veer.cs.vu.nl" as FQDN, and "Amsterdam.NL.EU.undernet.org" as
# server name.
# A "server mask" is something like "*.EU.UnderNet.org", which is
# matched by "Amsterdam.NL.EU.undernet.org" but not by
# "Manhattan.KS.US.undernet.org".
#
# Please do NOT just rename the example.conf to ircd.conf and expect
# it to work.

# [Include]
#
# Include the contents of the specified file.
#
# Include "path/to/include/file";

# [General]
#
# First some information about the server.
# General {
#         name = "servername";
#         vhost = "ipv4vhost";
#         vhost = "ipv6vhost";
#         description = "description";
#         numeric = numericnumber;
#         dns vhost = "ipv4vhost";
#         dns vhost = "ipv6vhost";
#         dns server = "ipaddress";
#         dns server = "ipaddress2";
# };
#
# If present, <virtual host> must contain a valid address in dotted
# quad or IPv6 numeric notation (127.0.0.1 or ::1).  The address MUST
# be the address of a physical interface on the host.  This address is
# used for outgoing connections if the Connect{} block does not
# override it.  See Port{} for listener virtual hosting.  If in doubt,
# leave it out -- or use "*", which has the same meaning as no vhost.
#
# You may specify both an IPv4 virtual host and an IPv6 virtual host,
# to indicate which address should be used for outbound connections
# of the respective type.
#
# Note that <server numeric> has to be unique on the network your server
# is running on, must be between 0 and 4095, and is not updated on a rehash.
#
# The two DNS lines allow you to specify the local IP address to use
# for DNS lookups ("dns vhost") and one or more DNS server addresses
# to use.  If the vhost is ambiguous for some reason, you may list
# IPV4 and/or IPV6 between the equals sign and the address string.
# The default DNS vhost is to let the operating system assign the
# address, and the default DNS servers are read from /etc/resolv.conf.
# In most cases, you do not need to specify either the dns vhost or
# the dns server.
General {
         name = "London.UK.Eu.UnderNet.org";
         description = "University of London, England";
         numeric = 1;
};

# [Admin]
#
# This sets information that can be retrieved with the /ADMIN command.
# It should contain at least an admin Email contact address.
Admin {
  # At most two location lines are allowed...
  Location = "The University of London";
  Location = "Undernet IRC server";
  Contact = "IRC Admins <irc@london.ac.uk>";
};

# [Classes]
#
# All connections to the server are associated with a certain "connection
# class", be they incoming or outgoing (initiated by the server), be they
# clients or servers.
#
# Class {
#  name = "<class>";
#  pingfreq = time;
#  connectfreq = time;
#  maxlinks = number;
#  maxchans = number;
#  sendq = size;
#  recvq = size;
#  usermode = "+i";
#  snomask = number;
#  fakelagminimum = number;
#  fakelagfactor = number;
#  autojoinchannel = "channellist";
#  autojoinnotice = "autojoinnotice";
#  restrict_join = yes/no;
#  restrict_privmsg = yes/no;
#  restrict_umode = yes/no;
# };
#
# For connection classes used on server links, maxlinks should be set
# to either 0 (for hubs) or 1 (for leaf servers).  Client connection
# classes may use maxlinks between 0 and approximately 4,000,000,000.
# maxlinks = 0 means there is no limit on the number of connections
# using the class.
# 
# <connect freq> applies only to servers, and specifies the frequency 
# that the server tries to autoconnect. setting this to 0 will cause
# the server to attempt to connect repeatedly with no delay until the 
# <maximum links> condition is satisfied. This is a Bad Thing(tm).
# Note that times can be specified as a number, or by giving something
# like: 1 minutes 20 seconds, or 1*60+20.
#
# <snomask> applies only to classes used for Operator blocks and is
# used to specify the server notice mask an oper gets when he/she uses
# /oper. See doc/snomask.txt or doc/snomask.html for details on what
# this number means.
#
# <fakelagminimum> is the minimum number of seconds to wait before
# processing commands received from clients.
#
# <fakelagfactor> is a number to devide the message length by to
# determine addtional fake lag to apply. If set to 0 (zero) the user
# will not be subject to fake lag at all.
#
# <autojoinchannel> can be specified to automatically join users of the
# class into. If <autojoinnotice> is specified then a notice is sent
# to the user when automatically joined.
#
# <restrict_join> when enabled restricts users in the class from joining
# any channel with the exception of channels specified in the
# autojoinchannel class option.
#
# <restrict_privmsg> when enabled prevents users in the class from
# sending PRIVMSG or NOTICE to other users who are not on the same
# channel as the user.
#
# <restrict_umode> when enabled prevents users in the class from
# changing their user modes.
#
# Recommended server classes:
# All your server uplinks you are not a hub for.

 name = "Server";
 pingfreq = 1 minutes 30 seconds;
 connectfreq = 5 minutes;

# };
#
# Everything in a Client block is optional.  If a username mask is
# given, it must match the client's username from the IDENT protocol.
# If a host mask is given, the client's hostname must resolve and
# match the host mask.  If a CIDR-style IP mask is given, the client
# must have an IP matching that range.  If maxlinks is given, it is
# limits the number of matching clients allowed from a particular IP
# address.
#
# Take the following class blocks only as a guide.

 # For connection classes intended for operator use, you can specify
 # privileges used when the Operator block (see below) names this
 # class.  The local (aka globally_opered) privilege MUST be defined
 # by either the Class or Operator block.  The following privileges
 # exist:
 #
 # local (or propagate, with the opposite sense)
 # whox  (log oper's use of x flag with /WHO)

 #  rehash, local_gline, local_jupe, local_opmode, whox, display,
 #  force_local_opmode, local_shun and local_zline
 # Any privileges listed in a Class block override the defaults.

};
# [Client]
#
# To allow clients to connect, they need authorization. This can be
# done based on hostmask, address mask, and/or with a password.
# With intelligent use of classes and the maxconnections field in the
# Client blocks, you can let in a specific domain, but get rid of all other
# domains in the same toplevel, thus setting up some sort of "reverse
# Kill block".
# Client {
#  host = "user@host";
#  ip = "user@ip";
#  password = "password";
#  class = "classname";
#  sslfp = "sslfingerprint";
#  noidenttilde = yes/no;
#  hidehostcomponents = number;
#  autojoinchannel = "channellist";
#  autojoinnotice = "autojoinnotice";
# };
#
# Technical description (for examples, see below):
# For every connecting client, the IP address is known.  A reverse lookup
# on this IP-number is done to get the (/all) hostname(s).
# Each hostname that belongs to this IP-number is matched to <hostmask>,
# and the Client {} is used when any matches; the client will then show
# with this particular hostname.  If none of the hostnames match, then
# the IP-number is matched against the <IP mask ...> field, if this matches
# then the Client{} is used nevertheless and the client will show with the
# first (main) hostname if any; if the IP-number did not resolve then the
# client will show with the dot notation of the IP-number.
# There is a special case for the UNIX domain sockets and localhost connections
# though; in this case the <IP mask ...> field is compared with the
# name of the server (thus not with any IP-number representation). The name
# of the server is the one returned in the numeric 002 reply, for example:
# 002 Your host is 2.undernet.org[jolan.ppro], running version ...
# Then the "jolan.ppro" is the name used for matching.
# Therefore, unix domain sockets, and connections to localhost would
# match this block:
# host = "*@jolan.ppro";
#
# This is the "fallback" entry. All .uk, .nl, and all unresolved are
# in these two lines.
# By using two different lines, multiple connections from a single IP
# are only allowed from hostnames which have both valid forward and
# reverse DNS mappings.

# from "*.swipnet.se" and at most two connections from dial up accounts
# that have "dial??.*" as host mask:

# [UWorld]
#
# One of the many nice features of Undernet is "Uworld", a program
# connected to the net as a server. This allows it to broadcast any mode
# change, thus allowing opers to, for example, "unlock" a channel that
# has been taken over.
# There is only one slight problem: the TimeStamp protocol prevents this.
# So there is a configuration option to allow them anyway from a certain
# server.
# UWorld {
#  # The servername or wildcard mask for it that this applies to.
#  name = "relservername";
# };
#
# You may have have more than one name listed in each block.
#
# Note: (1) These lines are agreed on by every server admin on Undernet;
# (2) These lines must be the same on every single server, or results
# will be disasterous; (3) This is a useful feature, not something that
# is a liability and abused regularly (well... :-)
# If you're on Undernet, you MUST have these lines. I cannnot stress
# this enough.  If all of the servers don't have the same lines, the
# servers will try to undo the mode hacks that Uworld does.  Make SURE that
# all of the servers have the EXACT same UWorld blocks.
#
# If your server starts on a bit larger network, you'll probably get
# assigned one or two uplinks to which your server can connect.
# If your uplink(s) also connect to other servers than yours (which is
# probable), you need to define your uplink as being allowed to "hub".
# See the Connect block documentation for details on how to do that.

# [Kill]
#
# While running your server, you will most probably encounter individuals
# or groups of persons that you do not wish to have access to your server.
#
# For this purpose, the ircd understands "kill blocks". These are also
# known as K-lines, by virtue of the former config file format.
# Kill
# {
#   host = "user@host";
#   reason = "The reason the user will see";
# };
# It is possible to ban on the basis of the real name.
# It is also possible to use a file as comment for the ban, using
# file = "file":
# Kill
# {
#   realname = "realnametoban";
#   file = "path/to/file/with/reason/to/show";
# };
# It is also possible to ban using either the 2 letter country code or
# the 2 letter continent code provided by GeoIP using either the country
# or continent fields.
# Kill
# {
#   country = "US";
#   reason = "Local server for local people!";
# };
#
#
# The default reason is: "You are banned from this server"
# Note that Kill blocks are local to the server; if you ban a person or a
# whole domain from your server, they can get on IRC via any other server
# that doesn't have them Killed (yet).
#
# With a simple comment, using quotes:
Kill { host = "*.au"; reason = "Please use a nearer server"; };
Kill { host = "*.edu"; reason = "Please use a nearer server"; };

# You can also kill based on username.
Kill { username = "sub7"; realname = "s*7*"; reason = "You are infected with a Trojan"; };

# The file can contain for example, a reason, a link to the
# server rules and a contact address.  Note the combination
# of username and host in the host field.

# IP-based kill lines apply to all hosts, even if an IP address has a
# properly resolving host name.
Kill
{

 file = "klines/martians";
};

# The realname field lets you ban by realname...
Kill

# The version field lets you ban by CTCP version (requires "CTCP_VERSION" and
# "CTCP_VERSIONING_KILL" to be enabled in the Features block)
Kill
{
  version = "*iroffer*";
  reason = "You are using a disallowed chat client version. Either upgrade or get a new client.";
};

# A Kill block can also allow authenticated users to connect even if they match
# the kill block in question. This can be achieved by adding the authexempt
# option to the kill block. Addition of the mark option will add a line to the
# users WHOIS with the value of the mark option.

# [Connect]
#
# You probably want your server connected to other servers, so your users
# have other users to chat with.
# IRC servers connect to other servers forming a network with a star or
# tree topology. Loops are not allowed.
# In this network, two servers can be distinguished: "hub" and "leaf"
# servers. Leaf servers connect to hubs; hubs connect to each other.
# Of course, many servers can't be directly classified in one of these
# categories. Both a fixed and a rule-based decision making system for
# server links is provided for ircd to decide what links to allow, what
# to let humans do themselves, and what links to (forcefully) disallow.
#

# define what servers the server connect to, and which servers are
# allowed to connect.
# Connect {
#  name = "servername";
#  host = "hostnameORip";
#  vhost = "localIP";
#  password = "passwd";
#  port = portno;
#  class = "classname";
#  maxhops = 2;
#  hub = "*.eu.undernet.org";
#  autoconnect = no;
#  sslfp = "sslfingerprint";
#  sslciphers = "ssl ciphers string";
#  ssl = no;
# };
#
# The "port" field defines the default port the server tries to connect
# to if an operator uses /connect without specifying a port. This is also
# the port used when the server attempts to auto-connect to the remote
# server. (See Class blocks for more informationa about auto-connects).
# You may tell ircu to not automatically connect to a server by adding
# "autoconnect = no;"; the default is to autoconnect.
#
# If the vhost field is present, the server will use that IP as the
# local end of connections that it initiates to this server.  This
# overrides the vhost value from the General block.
#
# If the sslfp field is present the remote server must be connected via
# SSL using an SSL certificate with the SHA256 fingerprint specified to
# be allowed to use the Connect block.
#
# If the ssliphers field is present then the ciphers list specified will
# be used when this server connects to the server the Connect block
# belongs to. See https://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html for an
# explanation on how to format this string.
#
# The maxhops field causes an SQUIT if a hub tries to introduce
# servers farther away than that; the element 'leaf;' is an alias for
# 'maxhops = 0;'.  The hub field limits the names of servers that may
# be introduced by a hub; the element 'hub;' is an alias for
# 'hub = "*";'.

# [crule]
#
# For an advanced, real-time rule-based routing decision making system
# you can use crule blocks. For more information, see doc/readme.crules.
# If more than one server mask is present in a single crule, the rule
# applies to all servers.
# CRULE
# {
#  server = "servermask";
#  rule = "connectrule";
#  # Setting all to yes makes the rule always apply. Otherwise it only
#  # applies to autoconnects.
#  all = yes;
# };
CRULE
{
 server = "*.US.UnderNet.org";
 rule = "connected(*.US.UnderNet.org)";
};
CRULE
{
 server = "*.EU.UnderNet.org";
 rule = "connected(Amsterdam.NL.EU.*)";
};

# The following block is recommended for leaf servers:
CRULE
{
 server = "*";
 rule = "directcon(*)";
};

# [Operator]
#
# Inevitably, you have reached the part about "IRC Operators". Oper status
# grants some special privileges to a user, like the power to make the
# server break or (try to) establish a connection with another server,
# and to "kill" users off IRC.
# I can write many pages about this; I will restrict myself to saying that
# if you want to appoint somebody as IRC Operator on your server, that
# person should be aware of his/her responsibilities, and that you, being
# the admin, will be held accountable for their actions.
#
# There are two sorts of IRC Operators: "local" and "global". Local opers
# can squit, connect and kill - but only locally: their +o user mode
# is not not passed along to other servers. On Undernet, this prevents
# them from using Uworld as well.
#
# More than one host = "mask"; entry may be present in one block; this
# has the same effect as one Operator block for each host entry, but
# makes it easier to update operator nicks, passwords, classes, and
# privileges.
#
# Operator {
#  host = "host/IP mask";
#  name = "opername";
#  password = "encryptedpass";
#  class = "classname";
#  sslfp = "sslfingerprint";
#  snomask = number;
#  autojoinchannel = "channellist";
#  autojoinnotice = "autjoinnotice";
#  # You can also set any operator privilege; see the Class block
#  # documentation for details.  A privilege defined for a single
#  # Operator will override the privilege settings for the Class
#  # and the default setting.
# };
#
# By default, the password is hashed using the system's native crypt()
# function.  Other password mechanisms are available; the umkpasswd
# utility from the ircd directory can hash passwords using those
# mechanisms.  If you use a password format that is NOT generated by
# umkpasswd, ircu will not recognize the oper's password.
#
# If sslfp is present the user must be connected via SSL from a client
# setup to use an SSL client certificate with the SHA256 fingerprint
# specified.
#
# snomask is used to specify the server notice mask an oper gets when
# he/she uses /oper. See doc/snomask.txt or doc/snomask.html for
# details on what this number means.
#
# autjoinchannel allows you to specify channels the user is automatically
# joined into when he/she uses /oper. Additionally you can specify a
# notice to be sent to the user by using autojoinnotice.
#
# All privileges are shown with their default values; if you wish to
# override defaults, you should set only those privileges for the
# operator.  Listing defaulted privileges just makes things harder to
# find.
Operator {
 local = no;
 host = "*@*.cs.vu.nl";
 password = "VRKLKuGKn0jLt";
 name = "Niels";
 class = "Local";
};
Operator {
 host = "*@*.uu.net";
 password = "$PLAIN$notencryptedpass";
 name = "Niels";
 class = "Opers";
};

# Note that the <connection class> is optional, but leaving it away
# puts the opers in class "default", which usually only accepts one
# connection at a time.  If you want users to Oper up more then once per
# block, then use a connection class that allows more then one connection,
# for example (using class Local as in the example above):
#
# Once you OPER your connection class changes no matter where you are or
# your previous connection classes.  If the defined connection class is
# Local for the operator block, then your new connection class is Local.

# [Port]
# When your server gets more full, you will notice delays when trying to
# connect to your server's primary listening port. It is possible via the
# Port lines to specify additional ports for the ircd to listen to.
# De facto ports are: 6667 - standard; 6660-6669 - additional client
# ports;
# Undernet uses 4400 for server listener ports.
# These are just hints, they are in no way official IANA or IETF policies.
# IANA says we should use port 194, but that requires us to run as root,
# so we don't do that.
#
#
# Port {
#  port = [ipv4] [ipv6] number;
#  mask = "ipmask";
#  # Use this to control the interface you bind to.
#  vhost = [ipv4] [ipv6] "virtualhostip";
#  # You can specify both virtual host and port number in one entry.
#  vhost = [ipv4] [ipv6] "virtualhostip" number;
#  # Setting to yes makes this server only.
#  server = yes;
#  # Setting to yes makes the port "hidden" from stats.
#  hidden = yes;
#  # Setting to yes makes the port accept SSL encrypted connections.
#  ssl = yes;
# };
#
# The port and vhost lines allow you to specify one or both of "ipv4"
# and "ipv6" as address families to use for the port.  The default is
# to listen on both IPv4 and IPv6.
#
# The mask setting allows you to specify a range of IP addresses that
# you will allow connections from. This should only contain IP addresses
# and '*' if used. This field only uses IP addresses. This does not use
# DNS in any way so you can't use it to allow *.nl or *.uk. Attempting
# to specify anything other than numbers, dots and stars [0-9.*] will result
# in the port allowing connections from anyone.
#
# The interface setting allows multiply homed hosts to specify which
# interface to use on a port by port basis, if an interface is not specified
# the default interface will be used. The interface MUST be the complete
# IP address for a real hardware interface on the machine running ircd.
# If you want to use virtual hosting *YOU* *MUST* *USE* *THIS* otherwise it
# WILL bind to all interfaces - not what most people seem to expect.
#
Port {
 server = yes;
 port = 4400;
};

# This is an SSL port.
Port {
 ssl = yes;
 port = 6697;
};

# This is an IPv4-only Server port that is Hidden

Port {
 # This only accepts clients with IPs like 192.168.*.
 mask = "192.168.*";
 port = 6666;

# More than one vhost may be present in a single Port block; in this case,

# [Spoofhost]
#
# Spoofhost "<spoof host>" {
#   pass = "<password>";
#   host = "<hostmask>";
#   autoapply = <yes/no>;
#   ismask = <yes/no>;
#   matchusername = <yes/no>;
# };
#
# <spoof host>  An ident@hostname or hostname to be spoofed
# <password>    A password for this spoof host. Used if SETHOST_USER is enabled.
# <hostmask>    A hostmask for matching against users that are to be auto
#               spoofed or to restrict access to a spoof host.
# <autoapply>   Either yes or no, yes indicates that the Spoofhost should be
#               automatically applied to a user. If set to yes, <pass> is
#               ignored when automatically applying the host.
# <ismask>      Either yes or no, yes indicates that <spoof host> is a wild
#               card mask (includes * or ?) to match against the supplied spoof
#               host. A yes also sets <autoapply> to no.
# <matchusername> If set to yes when <autoapply> is set to yes, the user portion
#               of <hostmask> will match against the USER supplied user name
#               as well as the ident supplied user name.
#
# NOTE: When using ismask steps should be taken to ensure only users you trust
#       can make use of a Spoofhost block using the option. The reason for this
#       is because of the nature of ismask, users who can use a Spoofhost block
#       with ismask enabled can make use of a wild card mask to change their
#       host name and evade channel bans.
#
# Spoofhost "testsline.AfterNET.Org"  { pass = "secret"; host = "*"; };
#
# This is how to define Spoofhosts when having freeform turned off.
# Spoofhost "testsline2.AfterNET.Org" { username = "x"; host = "nohost"; };

# Quarantine blocks disallow operators from using OPMODE and CLEARMODE
# on certain channels.  Opers with the force_opmode (for local
# channels, force_local_opmode) privilege may override the quarantine
# by prefixing the channel name with an exclamation point ('!').
# Wildcards are NOT supported; the channel name must match exactly.
Quarantine {
  "#shells" = "Thou shalt not support the h4><0rz";
  "&kiddies" = "They can take care of themselves";
};

# This is a server-implemented alias to send a message to a service.
# The string after Pseudo is the command name; the name entry inside
# is the service name, used for error messages.  More than one nick
# entry can be provided; the last one listed has highest priority.
Pseudo "CHANSERV" {
 name = "X";
 nick = "X@channels.undernet.org";
};

# You can also prepend text before the user's message.
Pseudo "LOGIN" {
 name = "X";
 prepend = "LOGIN ";
 nick = "X@channels.undernet.org";
};

# You can also specify the default text to send if the user does not
# supply some text.
Pseudo "AUTHSERV" {
 name = "AuthServ";
 nick = "AuthServ@channels.undernet.org";
 defaulttext = "HELP";
};

# You can ask a separate server whether to allow users to connect.
# Uncomment this ONLY if you have an iauth helper program.
# IAuth {
#  program = "../path/to/iauth" "-n" "options go here";
# };

# [Forwards]
# These blocks will enable the server to forward any messages which
# are prefixed and specific with a b:line. This will allow users to
# use the services without the services being in channel.
#
# Forwards {
#   "<prefix>" = "<services server>";
# };
#
# Forwards {
#   "!" = "channels.undernet.org";
#   "?" = "channels.undernet.org";
#   "." = "channels.undernet.org";
# };
#
# Any channel messages prefixed with a ? ! or a . would be sent to
# channels.undernet.org in the above examples.

# [WebIRC]
# These blocks allow you to run a WEBIRC client on your website without
# having to set clone exceptions for your websites hostname on your IRCd.
# WEBIRC will send a WEBIRC command along with the clients hostname, ip and
# WEBIRC password.
#
# WebIRC {
#  host = "user@host";
#  password = "password";
#  ident = "fakeident";
#  userident = yes/no;
#  ignoreident = yes/no;
#  stripsslfp = yes/no;
#  description = "description";
# };
#
# The host and password fields take the same formats as in the Client block.
# The host field is matched against the host mask of the client attempting
# to use the WEBIRC command. The ident field is optional and if specified
# is used as if it were the reply from the users identd. The ignoreident
# option causes any identd reply already received to be ignored. The
# userident option uses the USER user name as if it were an identd reply if
# none was received or if ignoreident is set to yes. The description field is
# a short line of text to be added to the user's WHOIS to mark them as a
# WEBIRC user. If the client issuing the WEBIRC command uses an SSL client
# certificate then stripsslfp should be set to yes.
#
# Example:
# WebIRC {
#  host = "*@127.0.0.1";
#  password = "$PLAIN$kg533n6xVI";
# };

# [Except]
# These blocks allow you to exempt matching clients from various
# restrictions or checks.
#
# Except {
#  host = "user@host";
#  shun = yes/no;
#  kline = yes/no;
#  gline = yes/no;
#  ident = yes/no;
#  rdns = yes/no;
#  ipcheck = yes/no;
#  targetlimit = yes/no;
# };
#
# The host field is used to specify a user@host mask to select clients to
# apply the exemptions to. For some exemption types such as ipcheck, ident and
# rdns, you can only specify a mask of *@<ip> or *@<cidr> as neither ident nor
# rDNS checks have been performed when exceptions have been checked. The kline
# type exempts users from Kill blocks in ircd.conf that the client matches.
# The gline and shun types exempt matching clients from glines and shuns
# respectively. The ident and rdns types stop the IRCd from performing ident
# and reverse DNS lookups for matching clients. The ipcheck type exempts
# matching clients from connection throttling and IP limits. The targetlimit
# type exempts matching clients from the message target limits.

# [features]
# IRC servers have a large number of options and features.  Most of these
# are set at compile time through the use of #define's--see "make config"
# for more details--but we are working to move many of these into the
# configuration file.  Features let you configure these at runtime.
# You only need one feature block in which you use
# "featurename" = "value1" , "value2", ..., "valuen-1", "valuen";
#
# The entire purpose of F:lines are so that you do not have to recompile
# the IRCD everytime you want to change a feature.  All of the features
# are listed below, and at the bottom is how to set logging.
#
# A Special Thanks to Kev for writing the documentation of F:lines.  It can
# be found at doc/readme.features and the logging documentation can be
# found at doc/readme.log.  The defaults used by the Undernet network are
# below.
